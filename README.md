# Python Resources

## Live Coding Examples

The live coding examples (created during the course) with added comments can be found in the **day_1** and **day_2** folders.

## Exercises

### Pandas Exercises

Data can be found in the **/files** folder
There are two jupyter notebooks for pandas related exercises:

* Exercises: exercises.ipynb
* Solutions: exercise_solutions.ipynb

### Visualizations

The notebook for visualization demonstrations are in the notebook **visualization_guide.ipynb**.
If you would like to investigate other types of visualizations, you can find more in the [Seaborn library documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html). 

### Additional Pandas and Numpy Exercises

During the course, we cloned and investigated the examples in the following repository:

 - [NumpyPandas Course](https://github.com/guiwitz/NumpyPandas_course)

## Books

Recommended reading:

* **Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)** by Eric Matthes: A project-oriented book for Python beginners. 
* **Hands On Data Analysis With Pandas** by Stefanie Molin: An analytics course for intermediate Python programmers.

## Web Resources

Here are some other recommended resources:
* [Leetcode: Python Exercises](https://leetcode.com/problemset/?language=Python)
* [Leetcode: Pandas Exercises](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-pandas/)
* [Choosing the Right Visualization](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
* [Pandas Crash Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xUgesdShE8)
* [Learn Data Analysis with Python](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/data-analysis-with-python-probability-statistics/)
* [Intro to Computer Science](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) (Highly recommended, however more of a focus on a deeper understanding programming and algorithms rather than direct applicability)

## Learning Git
Basic usage of git (and Github) is outlined in the file **github_instructions.md**.
Becoming proficient in git (by understanding both the branching/merging behaviour as well as memorising the commands) can take time, but there are several helful resources, some of which are linked below:

* [Laymans Introduction to Git](https://webtuu.com/blog/04/a-laymans-introduction-to-git)
* [Learn Branching and Merging - Gamified](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Advanced Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## AI Coding
A document called **KPI_Dashboard_Demo.pdf** shows examples of how to work with the AI coding assistant Cline to build a KPI dashboard. It shows the progression of coding manually towards using spec-driven programming with AI.
